# OpenGl


If you are new to **OpenGl** , this presentation will give you an overview picture of **OpenGl** and how its related to software Engineering .

After you finish reading this repository , you will know the main principles behind OpenGl and you will be able to write your first program and draw a simple scene in **OpenGl**  effictive GO code.

and most importantly , you will know how **OpenGL** helps software engineers with the task of building applications that use 3D graphics .
