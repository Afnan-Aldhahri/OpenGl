# What is OpenGl ?

As [OpenGL Programming Guide](https://github.com/Afnan-Aldhahri/OpenGl/blob/master/Resources/References.md) defined OpenGL :

**OpenGL** is a software interface to graphics hardware. 

This interface include 150 distinct commands that state the objects and operations required to generate

interactive three-dimensional applications.

**OpenGL** is designed as a streamlined, hardware-independent interface to be used with a variety of hardware platforms. 

To accomplish these characteristics, no commands for performing windowing tasks or obtaining user input are included in OpenGL; 

instead, you have to deal with any windowing system controls the specific hardware you're using. 

OpenGL doesn't provide high-level commands for describing models of three-dimensional objects. 

Such commands might allow you to specify relatively complicated shapes such as automobiles, parts of the body, airplanes, 

or molecules.

With **OpenGL**, you must develop your  model by combining different small geometric primitives - points, lines, and polygons.

You can use an external library  on top of OpenGL.

The OpenGL Utility Library (GLU) provides many of the modeling characteristics, such as quadric surfaces and NURBS curves and surfaces.

GLU is a standard part of every OpenGL implementation.

Also, there is a higher-level, object-oriented toolkit, Open Inventor, which is built atop OpenGL, and is available separately for many implementations of OpenGL.
