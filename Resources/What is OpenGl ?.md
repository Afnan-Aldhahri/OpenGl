# What is OpenGl ?

As [OpenGL Programming Guide](https://github.com/Afnan-Aldhahri/OpenGl/blob/master/Resources/References.md) defined OpenGL :

**OpenGL** is a software interface to graphics hardware. 

This interface consists of about 150 distinct commands that you use to specify the objects and operations needed to produce

interactive three-dimensional applications.

**OpenGL** is designed as a streamlined, hardware-independent interface to be implemented on many different hardware platforms. 

To achieve these qualities, no commands for performing windowing tasks or obtaining user input are included in OpenGL; 

instead, you must work through whatever windowing system controls the particular hardware you're using. 

Similarly, OpenGL doesn't provide high-level commands for describing models of three-dimensional objects. 

Such commands might allow you to specify relatively complicated shapes such as automobiles, parts of the body, airplanes, 

or molecules.

With **OpenGL**, you must build up your desired model from a small set of geometric primitives - points, lines, and polygons.

A sophisticated library that provides these features could certainly be built on top of OpenGL.

The OpenGL Utility Library (GLU) provides many of the modeling features, such as quadric surfaces and NURBS curves and surfaces.

GLU is a standard part of every OpenGL implementation.

Also, there is a higher-level, object-oriented toolkit, Open Inventor, which is built atop OpenGL, and is available separately

for many implementations of OpenGL.
