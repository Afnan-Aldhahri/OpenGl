## Evolution of the OpenGL

**OpenGL** was first created as an *open* and *reproducable alternative* to Iris GL which had been the proprietary graphics API on Silicon Graphics workstations.

Although OpenGL was initially *similar* in some respects to IrisGL ,the lack of a formal specification and conformance tests made Iris GL unsuitable for broader adoption. 

**Mark Segal** and **Kurt Akeley** authored the OpenGL 1.0 specification which tried to formalize the definition of a useful graphics API and made cross platform non-SGI 3rd party implementation and support viable.
