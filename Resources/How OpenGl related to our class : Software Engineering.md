##How OpenGl related to our class : Software Engineering


After reading this repository , I am sure you now know that Opengl will be used in the **Implementation phase** of the software life cycle .

Software Engineer will defenitly consider  using Opengl if at least one of the user requierments(user stories) require modeling a 2d or 3d scene , bulding a game , or simulating a picture .

of course there are many other application rather than Opengl that do the same job .However , Software Engineer probably will settle to choose Opengl for many reaseons.Opengl is cross-platform , language-independent and most importantly , easy to learn.
