##How OpenGl related to our class : Software Engineering


After reading this repository , I am sure you now know that Opengl will be used in the **Implementation phase** of the software life cycle .

Software Engineer will defenitly consider using Opengl if at least **one of the user requierments**(user stories) require modeling a 2d or 3d scene , bulding a game , or simulating a picture .

of course there are many other application rather than Opengl that do the same job .

However , Software Engineer probably will settle to choose Opengl for many reaseons.Opengl is cross-platform , language-independent and most importantly , easy to learn.

For more details ,check [why Opengl ?](https://github.com/Afnan-Aldhahri/OpenGl/blob/master/Resources/Why%20OpenGl%3F.md).


**but what if none of the software Engineers in the team know how to use Opengl ?**

Simply , they can create **a spike** .


lets see some **example of a job oppertuonity** that target **software engineer whith expeirence with Opengl** :-

**Software Engineer job description :**
