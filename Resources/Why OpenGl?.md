# Why OpenGl?

### 1-simple, easy 

 If you know how to program at a reasonable level (ex you can work  with varibles,data structures,functions ..etc) ,
 
 then opengl is pretty simple.



### 2- OpenGL is cross-platform :

As *Mark Sinnathamby* said in his article about [cross platform games ](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/358223/Cross-platform-game-design-and-development-using-O):"Why would anyone want to develop cross platform games, specifically using OpenGL? 

One main reason for adopting a cross platform strategy would be to reach a wider audience.

Startups and open source entities would benefit from this in many ways. 

Another aspect that is gaining momentum is the online and social gaming phenomenon that has been growing from few years back.

The games that are played on browsers and mobile devices are rapidly growing in number and complexity."

In addition to being platform-independent, OpenGL is also :

### 3- language-independent 

 you can write opengl programms in C,C++,java and more .
 
  According to Wikipedia , OpenGL has many language bindings, some of the most noteworthy being the JavaScript binding WebGL (API, based on   OpenGL ES 2.0, for 3D rendering from within a web browser);
  
  the C bindings WGL, GLX and CGL; the C binding provided by iOS; and the Java and C bindings provided by Android.
  
##4- OpenGL is better for the future of games
