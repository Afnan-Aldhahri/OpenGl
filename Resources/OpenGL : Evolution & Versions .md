## Evolution of the OpenGL

**OpenGL** was first created as an *open* and *reproducible alternative* to Iris GL .

Iris GL had been the graphics owner API on Silicon Graphics workstations.

At the beginning, OpenGL was  *similar*  to IrisGL some how. However, IrisGL has insufficient formal specification and conformance tests which make him inappropriate for broader adoption. 

**Mark Segal** and **Kurt Akeley** authored the OpenGL 1.0 specification which tried to legitimize the definition of a good graphics API and made cross platform non-SGI 3rd party implementation and support viable.
