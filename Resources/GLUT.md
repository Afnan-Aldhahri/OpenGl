##GLUT - The OpenGL Utility Toolkit

As [opengl.org] (https://www.opengl.org) defined GLUT ,

**GLUT** (pronounced like the glut in gluttony) is the OpenGL Utility Toolkit, a window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs.

It implements a simple windowing application programming interface (API) for OpenGL.

**GLUT** makes it considerably easier to learn about and explore OpenGL programming.

**GLUT** provides a portable API so you can write a single OpenGL program that works across all PC and workstation OS platforms.

**GLUT** is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs. 

While GLUT is well-suited to learning OpenGL and developing simple OpenGL applications,

**GLUT** is not a full-featured toolkit so large applications requiring sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window system toolkits. 

**GLUT** is simple, easy, and small.

The **GLUT library** has both C, C++ (same as C), FORTRAN, and Ada programming bindings.

The **GLUT source code distribution** is portable to nearly all OpenGL implementations and platforms. The current version is 3.7. Additional releases of the library are not anticipated.

GLUT is not open source. Mark Kilgard maintains the copyright. 

There are a number of newer and open source alternatives.

**The toolkit supports:**

* Multiple windows for OpenGL rendering
* Callback driven event processing
* Sophisticated input devices
* An 'idle' routine and timers
* A simple, cascading pop-up menu facility
* Utility routines to generate various solid and wire frame objects
* Support for bitmap and stroke fonts
* Miscellaneous window management functions
