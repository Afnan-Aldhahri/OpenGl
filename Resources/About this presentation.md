# About this presentation

This is my second presentation in CSCI 5828 â€” Fall 2015 (Foundations of Software Engineering)

My name is : Afnan Aldhahri

Note :

In Opengl basic & advanced sections ,I summerized the functions explanation from [OpenGL Programming Guide, Eighth Edition](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gopi/CS211B/opengl_programming_guide_8th_edition.pdf).

However, all the example codes are written by me .
